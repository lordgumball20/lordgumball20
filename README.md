# Hi there 👋
I'm LordGumball, I make amazing stuff like IoT electronics 🤖, Games 🎮, Multimedia 🎬, and so much more 💥. I spend my time and life working for my interests with passion as a hobby and benefits me a lot. 

I'd like to first and foremost thank my friends and family ❤ for keeping me highly motivated 😍 at all times 🕛 to keep moving forward daily and helping me testing 🛠 my stuff. 

I am an *Unico Hijo* 😲. Life is tough to be alone 👽 most of the time and I work alone ☹. I only know few people 🙁 that can help and will collaborate with me. It sure fun to work with someone 😄.
